{FC12}{C FF707070}Description: {C FF100801}You play as France. Your city is situated on an island in the centre of the map. There are two enemies to fight with. You start with a town center, academy, palace, market, barracks and church but only a single food village. There is little space available left in the city, so your dwellings and other structures will have to be built on the mainland. Be quick or be dead. Good luck!!!
